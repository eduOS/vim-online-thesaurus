# Vim Online Thesaurus

This is a plugin for Vim allowing you to look up words in an online thesaurus,
which is at the moment configured to be http://thesaurus.com/

The plugin displays the definition of the word under the cursor and a list of
synonyms.

## Usage

The plugin provides the `:OnlineThesaurusCurrentWord` command to look up the     
current word under the cursor in an online thesaurus. Alternatively, you can     
look up any word with `:Thesaurus word`.                                         
                                                                                 
Internally, both commands make a request to http://thesaurus.com/, parse the     
results, and display them in a vertical split in the bottom.                     
                                                                                 
By default the `:OnlineThesaurusCurrentWord` command is mapped to                
`<LocalLeader>K`.  If you haven't remapped `<LocalLeader>`, it defaults to `\`.  
To close the split, just press `q`.


## Configuration

If you want to disable the default key binding, add the following line to your
.vimrc:

let g:online_thesaurus_map_keys = 0

Then you can map the `:OnlineThesaurusCurrentWord` command to anything you want  
as follows:                                                                      
                                                                                 
nnoremap <your key binding> :OnlineThesaurusCurrentWord<CR>

Enjoy!
